```{r}

library(dagitty)


dag <- dagitty('dag {
  ParkingSpots -> Location
  ParkingSpots -> Sales
  Location -> Sales
}')


plot(dag)



customer_sat<- readRDS("customer_sat.rds")

model_1 <- lm(satisfaction ~ follow_ups, data = customer_sat)
summary(model_1)



model_2 <- lm(satisfaction ~ follow_ups + subscription, data = customer_sat)
summary(model_2)

coefficients_comparison <- data.frame(
  Model1 = coef(model_1),
  Model2 = coef(model_2)
)
print(coefficients_comparison)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(customer_sat, aes(x = follow_ups, y = satisfaction,)) +
  geom_point(shape = 16) +  
  labs(x = "Follow-up Calls", y = "Satisfaction", title = "Scatter Plot: Follow-up Calls vs Satisfaction") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") 
```
if we look ar the comaprision the model1 and model2, without subscription its not performing well as we should consider subscription as well
